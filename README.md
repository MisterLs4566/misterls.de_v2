# misterls.de_v2

Welcome to the repository for misterls.de v2!

## Introduction

I've always wanted to create my own website to have a publicly accessible place where I can showcase my projects and improve my web development skills. My previous website was created in 2021/2022 when I was a beginner in programming, using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
This repository has been created to work on a new version (v2) of my website and to share the code with anyone who is interested.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Styling**: CSS (and possibly a CSS framework)
- **Database**: TBD (To Be Decided)

## Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Interactive elements using React
